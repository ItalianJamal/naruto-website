									<h1>Naruto Plot Story</h1>
									<p>A summary of what the plotline of Naruto is about.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Naruto follows the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a spirited young ninja who dreams of becoming the Hokage, the strongest leader of his village despite being shunned for housing a powerful beast inside him. Alongside his teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, and under the guidance of their mentor Kakashi Hatake, Naruto takes on dangerous missions and faces powerful enemies. As the story unfolds, each character grows through personal struggles—Sasuke seeks revenge for his clan, Sakura works hard to become strong and useful, and Kakashi hides a tragic past behind his calm demeanor. Together, their journey shapes the future of the ninja world. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, Naruto’s determination and kindness begin to change those around him, even turning enemies into allies. Sasuke eventually leaves the village in pursuit of power, leading to a deep conflict between him and Naruto. Meanwhile, Sakura trains under the legendary Tsunade to become a powerful medical ninja, and Kakashi continues to support and guide his students while dealing with his own inner conflicts. The story builds toward an epic war that involves the entire ninja world, where the bonds between these characters are tested, and their growth becomes crucial in saving their world from destruction.</p>
